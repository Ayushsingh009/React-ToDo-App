# 📝 Modern React ToDo App

Back in the day, everyone built a ToDo app to land their first developer job.  
Now, it’s more of a **fun banter project** – but still one of the best ways to learn **React concepts** like `useState`, props, event handling, and styling.

This is my **learning journey project**, where I practiced:
- ⚛️ React basics (components, hooks, state management)
- 🎨 Modern minimalist CSS with animations
- 🗑 Task deletion + ✅ marking tasks as done
- ⌨️ "Enter" key support to add tasks
- 🖼 Clean UI with transitions

---

## 🚀 Features
- Add new tasks
- Delete tasks
- Mark tasks as done
- Smooth animations
- Modern & minimalist design

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- React + Vite
- CSS3 (minimalist, animated)
- UUID for unique IDs

---

## 💡 Reflection
Once upon a time, a **ToDo app could land you a job**.  
Today, it’s mostly a **rite of passage** for learning React.  
This project is my practice ground — the fun is in building, breaking, and fixing things while learning.

## 🔮 Future Scope
Since this is just a learning project, I may extend it further to explore more advanced concepts:

- 📦 **Persistent Storage** → Save todos in LocalStorage or IndexedDB  
- ☁️ **Backend Integration** → Store tasks in a database using Express + MongoDB  
- 🔑 **Authentication** → Users can log in and manage personal todo lists  
- 📱 **Responsive UI/UX** → Mobile-friendly design with Tailwind or Material UI  
- 🌙 **Dark Mode** → Theme toggle for modern look  
- 🔔 **Reminders & Notifications** → Notify users for pending tasks  
- 📊 **Task Categories & Filters** → Organize tasks by tags, priority, or status  
- 🎤 **Voice Input (fun experiment)** → Add tasks via microphone using Speech API

## 📌 Learning Goals
This repo is part of my **2025 learning journey**.  
I’ll keep iterating on it as I dive deeper into:
- MERN stack
- State management (Redux / Zustand)
- Cloud deployment (AWS / Docker)
- Realtime apps (WebSockets, Kafka, etc.)
